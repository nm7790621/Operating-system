# Operating-system
It is a operating system build in c++ .That dynamically manages the ram ores and storage .In kernel mode it ask you to if you want to change ram storage or number of cores and performs some task in  user mode.
I completed as part of my Operating Systems lab â€” a miniature operating system built from scratch! This system takes user input for RAM size and number of CPU cores, then dynamically manages resources using key OS concepts such as multithreading, process scheduling, memory management, and synchronization with mutexes. Throughout the development process, I gained practical experience in low-level programming and a deeper understanding of how modern operating systems handle concurrency, resource allocation, and task execution. It was a challenging yet rewarding experience that sharpened both my technical and problem-solving skills. Looking forward to exploring more in systems programming and beyond! ðŸ™‚
